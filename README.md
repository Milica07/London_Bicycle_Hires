### London_Bicycle_Hires
####BigQuery


BigQuery, a data warehouse on Google Cloud that I use to query, filter large datasets, aggregate results, and perform complex operations. In this mini project, I will upload public data to my console; and write some simple SQL queries using SELECT, FROM, and WHERE.


SELECT is the section of a query that indicates what data you want SQL to return to you

FROM is the section of a query that indicates which table the desired data comes from 

WHERE is the section of a query that indicates any filters you’d like to apply to your dataset


#####BigQuery: 
Used dataset: London Bicycle Hires dataset from the Greater London Authority -  london bicycle. -> london_bicycles data, table: cycle_hire
